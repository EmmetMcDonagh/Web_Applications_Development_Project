# Business Web_Applications_Development_Project
This repository contains a collection of files for the Web Application Development project submitted as part of the requirement for the Web Application Development module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Software Development. The actual project was to be submitted through the college Moodle platform as a zip file. This repository serves as a reference for the project.

The repository contains the following files:

    Several HTML files for each page of the website including index.html.
    A css subfolder containing the CSS stylesheet used to style the HTML pages.
    An img subfolder containing images in jpg and png format used in the Website.
    
The 'business' I chose is a used Mobile Phone store. I've employed a common design theme and colour scheme throughout as specified in the assignment brief. I created a business e-commerce website that employs the principles of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript which meets the requirements specified below.

Requirements
The website:
•	Allows the user to ‘purchase’ items from the site;
•	Allows the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated (via a login screen) before receiving a summary of the order;
•	Performs form validation through JavaScript to ensure that text fields are not empty; a valid email address is entered.
•	Connects to mysql database that contains relevant site information (eg: item information and user information);
•	It is responsive website, that displays on standard devices from large screen monitors, to tablets and phones. I've used the Bootstrap framework (via CDN).
•	For this project, 'purchase' means that the user is presented with the possibility to choose a product or item, select a quantity, and if the purchased button is clicked, they will be presented with a total cost.
